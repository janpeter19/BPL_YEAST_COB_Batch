# BPL_YEAST_COB_Batch

In this example we take a closer look at different ways to represent culture metabolism and growth
and we use a simplified version of previously used bottle-neck model of yeast. The model is simplified
to just show the coordination uptake and metabolism of glucose and ethanol. The important part
of ethanol formation is dropped to simplify. The focuse of the repository is to illustrate the 
idea of constrained-based modelling. This example was originally presented usering an ODE-model
but can can as well be described in terms of constraint-based modelling. Below a diagram that is
obtained in the notebook.
